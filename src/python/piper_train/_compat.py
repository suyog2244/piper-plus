"""Cross-platform compatibility shims.

Loaded eagerly when :mod:`piper_train` is imported so all entry points
(`export_onnx`, `infer`, `export_torchscript`, etc.) transparently
handle checkpoints produced by other platforms and Python versions.

Issues addressed:

- **PyTorch 2.6+ ``weights_only=True`` restriction**: ``pathlib`` classes
  must be registered as safe globals, because Lightning pickles
  ``PosixPath`` instances into ``hyper_parameters`` / callback state.
- **PosixPath instantiation on Windows**: without the module aliases
  below, ``torch.load(..., weights_only=False)`` on Windows raises
  ``UnsupportedOperation: cannot instantiate 'PosixPath' on your system``.

Why both module spellings are registered
----------------------------------------
``add_safe_globals([cls])`` (bare form) does **not** store the string the
pickle will contain. torch derives the registry key lazily, at lookup
time, from ``f"{cls.__module__}.{cls.__qualname__}"``
(``torch/_weights_only_unpickler.py``), while the unpickler looks the
pickled ``GLOBAL`` string up in that registry verbatim. So the key
depends on whatever ``pathlib.PosixPath.__module__`` happens to be in the
*reading* interpreter, not on what the *writing* one recorded.

CPython moved the concrete path classes into a private submodule in 3.13
and moved them back in 3.14. Measured ``pathlib.PosixPath.__module__``:

    3.11  -> "pathlib"          (``pathlib._local`` does not exist)
    3.12  -> "pathlib"
    3.13  -> "pathlib._local"   <- only this release
    3.14  -> "pathlib"          (``pathlib._local`` still importable,
                                 and is the very same class object)

A checkpoint written under 3.12 therefore pickles ``pathlib PosixPath``,
but a 3.13 reader registers only ``pathlib._local.PosixPath`` — the names
never match and the load fails with ``UnpicklingError`` even though the
shim "ran". The mirror case (3.13-written checkpoint read under 3.12)
fails the same way. Registering every spelling explicitly, via the
``(callable, name)`` tuple form, is what makes both directions work.

This module has no public API beyond
:func:`apply_windows_pathlib_aliases`; importing it for the side-effects
is the contract.

torch is imported lazily inside a ``try``/``except ImportError`` because
:mod:`piper_train` is also imported by lightweight CI jobs that don't
install torch (e.g. dataset / utility tests). The pathlib aliases
themselves only need :mod:`pathlib` + :mod:`platform`, so they always run.

    the alias on the public module. Both have to be rebound.

    Rebinding is safe for ordinary path construction: ``Path.__new__``
